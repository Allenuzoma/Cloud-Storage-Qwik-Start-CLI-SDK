# Cloud-Storage-Qwik-Start-CLI-SDK

Cloud Storage: Qwik Start -

Overview
Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

In this hands-on lab you will learn how to use Google Cloud command line to:

Create a storage bucket
Upload objects to the bucket
Create folders and subfolders in the bucket
Make objects in a storage bucket publicly accessible
Setup and requirements

Activate Cloud Shell
Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

Click Activate Cloud Shell Activate Cloud Shell icon at the top of the Google Cloud console.
When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your Project_ID, PROJECT_ID. The output contains a line that declares the Project_ID for this session:

Your Cloud Platform project in this session is set to "PROJECT_ID"
gcloud is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

(Optional) You can list the active account name with this command:
gcloud auth list
Copied!
Click Authorize.
Output:

ACTIVE: *
ACCOUNT: "ACCOUNT"

To set the active account, run:
    $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
(Optional) You can list the project ID with this command:
      gcloud config list project



Set the region
Set the project region for this lab:

    gcloud config set compute/region "REGION"

Task 1. Create a bucket
The Cloud Storage utility tool, gsutil, is installed and ready to use in Google Cloud. In this lab you use gsutil in Cloud Shell.

When you create a bucket you must follow the universal bucket naming rules, below.

Bucket naming rules

Do not include sensitive information in the bucket name, because the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible.
Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (-), underscores (_), and dots (.). Names containing dots require verification.
Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
Bucket names must contain 3 to 63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.
Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix.
Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings of "google".
Also, for DNS compliance and future compatibility, you should not use underscores (_) or have a period adjacent to another period or dash. For example, ".." or "-." or ".-" are not valid in DNS names.
Use the make bucket (mb) command to make a bucket, replacing <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME> with a unique name that follows the bucket naming rules:

  gsutil mb gs://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>

This command is creating a bucket with default settings. To see what those default settings are, use the Cloud console Navigation menu > Cloud Storage, then click on your bucket name, and click on the Configuration tab.

That's it â€” you've just created a Cloud Storage bucket!

Note: If the bucket name is already taken, either by you or someone else, the command returns:

    Creating gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/...
    ServiceException: 409 Bucket YOUR-BUCKET-NAME already exists.

Try again with a different bucket name.





Task 2. Upload an object into your bucket


Use Cloud Shell to upload an object into a bucket.

To download this image (ada.jpg) into your bucket, enter this command into Cloud Shell:
curl https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg/800px-Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg --output ada.jpg
Copied!
Use the gsutil cp command to upload the image from the location where you saved it to the bucket you created:


    gsutil cp ada.jpg gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME

Note: When typing your bucket name, you can use the tab key to autocomplete it.

You can see the image load into your bucket from the command line.

You've just stored an object in your bucket!

Now remove the downloaded image:

    rm ada.jpg

Task 3. Download an object from your bucket
Use the gsutil cp command to download the image you stored in your bucket to Cloud Shell:


    gsutil cp -r gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg .

If successful, the command returns:

    Copying gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg...
    / [1 files][360.1 KiB/2360.1 KiB]
    Operation completed over 1 objects/360.1 KiB.

You've just downloaded the image from your bucket.

*Task 4. Copy an object to a folder in the bucket*

Use the gsutil cp command to create a folder called image-folder and copy the image (ada.jpg) into it:


    gsutil cp gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/image-folder/

Note: Compared to local file systems, folders in Cloud Storage have limitations, but many of the same operations are supported.
If successful, the command returns:

    Copying gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg [Content-Type=image/png]...
    - [1 files] [ 360.1 KiB/ 360.1 KiB]
    Operation completed over 1 objects/360.1 KiB
    

The image file has been copied into a new folder in your bucket.




Task 5. List contents of a bucket or folder
Use the gsutil ls command to list the contents of the bucket:

    gsutil ls gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME

If successful, the command returns a message similar to:

    gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
    gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/image-folder/

    
That's everything currently in your bucket.

Task 6. List details for an object
Use the gsutil ls command, with the -l flag to get some details about the image file you uploaded to your bucket:
gsutil ls -l gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
Copied!
If successful, the command returns a message similar to:

306768  2017-12-26T16:07:570Z  gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
TOTAL: 1 objects, 30678 bytes (360.1 KiB)
Now you know the image's size and date of creation.

Task 7. Make your object publicly accessible
Use the gsutil acl ch command to grant all users read permission for the object stored in your bucket:
gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
Copied!
If successful, the command returns:

Updated ACL on gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
Your image is now public, and can be made available to anyone.

Test completed ask
Click Check my progress to verify your performed task. If you have successfully shared an object from your storage bucket, you will see an assessment score.

Make your object publicly accessible

Validate that your image is publicly available.

Go to Navigation menu > Cloud Storage, then click on the name of your bucket.
You should see your image with the Public link box. Click the Copy URL and open the URL in a new browser tab.

Note: Who are you looking at? This is Ada Lovelace, credited with being the first computer programmer. She worked with mathematician and computer pioneer Charles Babbage, who proposed the Analytical Engine.

Her interest in the Analytical Engine lead to translating a paper on the machine by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea, adding her own extensive annotations. These notes are considered the first computer program - an algorithm designed to be carried out by the machine. She developed a vision of the capability of computers, going beyond number crunching, and examined how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.

Test your understanding
Below is a multiple choice question to reinforce your understanding of this lab's concepts. Answer it to the best of your ability.


An access control list (ACL) is a mechanism you can use to define who has access to your buckets and objects.
check
True

False

Task 8. Remove public access
To remove this permission, use the command:
gsutil acl ch -d AllUsers gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
Copied!
If successful, the command returns:

Updated ACL on gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg
You have removed public access to this object.

Verify that you've removed public access by clicking the Refresh button in the console. The checkmark will be removed.
Test your understanding
Below is a multiple choice question to reinforce your understanding of this lab's concepts. Answer it to the best of your ability.


You can stop publicly sharing an object by removing the permission entry that has:

allUsers

By updating storage class

By removing project owner role

Delete objects
Use the gsutil rm command to delete an object - the image file in your bucket:


    gsutil rm gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg

If successful, the command returns:

Removing gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ada.jpg...
Refresh the console. The copy of the image file is no longer stored on Cloud Storage (though the copy you made in the image-folder/ folder still exists).


Congratulations!
